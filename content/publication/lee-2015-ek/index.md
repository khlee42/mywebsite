abstract: In this study we investigate whether social reference systems, such as Facebook
  ``likes'' (FBLs), promote sales in social commerce, wherein adverse selection and
  quality uncertainty often severely damage consumer trust and impede efforts to achieve
  sustainable growth. We also examine the extent to which product characteristics
  (product uncertainty and product franchising) and deal characteristics (tipping
  points, discount rates, and deal durations) moderate the social selling stimulated
  by FBLs. On the basis of 1,327 samples collected from a major social commerce platform
  provider, we identify several interesting empirical regularities regarding the relationship
  between FBLs and social commerce sales. The findings suggest that FBLs drive traffic
  and increase sales. Information technology artifacts and social technologies, such
  as FBLs, can endow a consumers shopping experience with a socialization component
  and induce social selling in collective buying platforms. Nevertheless, significant
  variations occur across products and deals. For example, consumers who purchase
  experience goods more frequently depend on FBLs than do those who buy search goods.
  FBLs exert a far greater influence on the sales of goods from independent stores
  than those from franchise chains. Social commerce consumers are unaffected by heavy
  discount rates as they make purchase decisions, but they extensively rely on FBLs,
  particularly when purchasing products that have low tipping points. Our results
  suggest that social commerce can be a powerful marketplace when the economic utility
  that is driven by price incentives is further strengthened and protected by the
  social utility that originates from trust and sharing.
