abstract: 'Despite the growing adoption of the mobile health (mHealth) applications
  (apps), few studies address concerns with low retention rates. This study aimed
  to investigate how the usage patterns of mHealth app functions affect user retention.
  We collected individual usage logs for 1,439 users of single tethered personal health
  record app, which spanned an 18-months period from August 2011 to January 2013.
  The user logs contained timestamps whenever an individual uses each function, which
  enables us to identify the usage patterns based on the intensity of using a particular
  function in the app. We then estimated how these patterns were related to 1) the
  app usage over time (using the random effect model) and 2) the probability of stopping
  the use of the application (using the Cox proportional hazard model). The analyses
  suggested that the users utilize the app most at the time of the adoption and gradually
  reduce their usage over time. The average duration of use after starting the app
  was 25.62 weeks (SD: 18.41). The degree of the usage reduction, however, decreases
  as the self-monitoring function is more frequently used (coefficient = 0.002, P
  = 0.013); none of the other functions has this effect. Moreover, engaging with the
  self-monitoring function frequently (coefficient = âˆ’0.18, P = 0.003) and regularly
  (coefficient = 0.10, P = 0.001) significantly also reduces the probability of abandoning
  the application. Specifically, the estimated survival rate indicates that, after
  40 weeks since the adoption, the probability of the regular users of self-monitoring
  to stay in use was about 80% while that of non-user was about 60%. This study provides
  the empirical evidence that sustained use of mHealth app is closely linked to the
  regular usage on self-monitoring function. The implications can be extended to the
  education of users and physicians to produce better outcomes as well as application
  development for effective user interfaces.'
