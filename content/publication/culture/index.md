abstract: 'This study examines how cultural differences between merging firms affect post-M&A performance in international M&As. Our study differs from prior literature in two important ways: (1) we focus on cultural differences in two particular dimensions - power distance and individualism/collectivism - rather than using the composite measure of cultural distance; (2) as the performance measure, we use abnormal operating performance, which captures the actual, realized value/costs that arise during the post-M&A integration process. Our theorization and empirical results suggest that the two dimensions of culture have distinct effects on a post-M&A outcome: while differences in power distance are negatively associated with post-M&A performance, those in individualism/collectivism positively affect such performance. We also find that these effects are significant only in M&A deals seeking operational rather than financial synergies. Our theoretical framework and empirical findings contribute to the operations management literature on culture in general and the literature on international M&As in particular by illuminating the differential effects of cultural differences in power distance and individualism/collectivism on post-integration outcomes.'
